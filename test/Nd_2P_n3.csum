 There are 3 electrons in the cloud
  in 132 relativistic CSFs
  based on 9 relativistic subshells.

The atomic number is  60.0000000000;
 the mass of the nucleus is  2.586819468830D+05 electron masses;
  Fermi nucleus:
  c = 1.100420501075D-04 Bohr radii,
  a = 9.890591365424D-06 Bohr radii;
  there are 82 tabulation points in the nucleus.

Speed of light =  1.370359990740D+02 atomic units.

 To H (Dirac Coulomb) is added
  H (Transverse) --- factor multiplying the photon frequency:  1.00000000D+00;
  H (Vacuum Polarisation);
  the total will be diagonalised.
 Diagonal contributions from H (Self Energy) will be estimated
  from a screened hydrogenic approximation.

Radial grid: R(I) = RNT*(exp((I-1)*H)-1), I = 1, ..., N;

 RNT  =  2.000000000000D-06 Bohr radii;
 H    =  5.000000000000D-02 Bohr radii;
